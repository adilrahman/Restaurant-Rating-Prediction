## Objective üéØ

Build a solution that should able to predict the ratings of the
restaurants based on some features that listed in the dataset.


## Poblem Statement ‚ùì

The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on
the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help
various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain features

## Dataset

## Technology 
Machine Learning Technology

## Domain 
E-commerce

## Programming Language

- Most Famous Restaurant in Bangalore are 
  1. Cafe Coffee Day
  2. Onesta
  3. Empire Restaurant

  5. Five Star Chicken
  
### Zomato Restaurant rate prediction ü§ñ
  - For prediction I have used **Extra Tree Regression Model** 
  - It performed very well among other models 
  
  #### Training r2_score :- 0.9735
  #### Testing r2_score  :- 0.8498
 
## Deployment üîó
- Web-application is deployed in Heroku
